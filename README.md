scratch高级功能插件
'''Scratch Plus Project'''
This is the Scratch advanced function plug-in that I spent a whole morning making, the process of using it:
 - 1 Open the installer,
 - 2 Wait for the installation to complete,
 - 3 Right-click on the newly created shortcut on the desktop,
 - 4 Select Run as administrator,
 - 5 Then you can set the software to start automatically when you boot up
 - 6 After installing the plugin, open the sample (*.sb3) work
